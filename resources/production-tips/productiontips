### Draft for **DIY Production Tips: A Mix Engineer’s Guide**

---

**Introduction**  
Producing music at home can be both rewarding and challenging. While tools and technology have made it easier than ever to create tracks, the fundamentals of mixing remain essential. As a mix engineer, I want to share some foundational tips to help you refine your productions and make them mix-ready. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to polish your sound, these techniques will elevate your music.

### **1. Start with Solid Gain Staging**  
Gain staging is one of the most critical steps in any production. It ensures your audio signals are neither too quiet (causing noise issues) nor too loud (causing distortion).  

- **Set Input Levels Properly**: Aim for peaks around -18 to -12 dBFS for most tracks. This leaves headroom for processing and prevents clipping.  
- **Check Throughout the Signal Chain**: Monitor levels at every stage—input, plugins, buses, and outputs—to maintain consistency.  

**Pro Tip:** Gain staging doesn’t just prevent technical issues; it also helps plugins perform optimally by staying within their designed dynamic range.

### **2. Think of the Mix as a Soundstage**  
David Gibson’s *The Art of Mixing* offers a powerful visual metaphor for crafting a mix: think of your sound as a 3D space. Consider three key dimensions:  

#### **A. Panning for Width**  
- Use panning to place elements across the stereo field. For example, keep kick drums and bass centered while panning guitars, synths, or percussion slightly left or right to create separation.  
- Avoid over-panning—too much can make your mix sound unnatural or disconnected.  

#### **B. Frequency for Height**  
- Lower frequencies (e.g., bass) anchor the bottom, while higher frequencies (e.g., cymbals) sit at the top.  
- Use EQ to carve space for each element, ensuring they complement rather than compete with each other.  

#### **C. Amplitude for Depth**  
- Volume and effects like reverb and delay create depth.  
- Push lead vocals or key instruments forward by keeping them louder and drier, while sending supporting elements further back with reverb.  

**Pro Tip:** Regularly listen to your mix at lower volumes to check the balance and ensure no element dominates unnecessarily.

### **3. Reference Tracks Are Your Best Friend**  
Select professionally mixed songs in a similar genre to your project and use them as benchmarks. Reference tracks help you:  
- Understand how elements like bass, vocals, and drums should sit in the mix.  
- Match tonal balance and loudness for competitive results.  

**Tip for Beginners:** Tools like reference plugins (e.g., Metric AB) make it easy to compare your mix to a reference track directly within your DAW.

### **4. Prioritize Clean Recordings**  
A clean recording is the foundation of a great mix. Spend time:  
- Reducing room noise with proper mic placement and acoustic treatment.  
- Editing out unwanted clicks, pops, or silence.  

**Why This Matters:** Even with great mixing techniques, poor-quality recordings can limit the final result.

### **5. The Power of Subtractive EQ**  
Before boosting frequencies, cut out unwanted ones.  
- Use a high-pass filter to remove low-end rumble on non-bass instruments.  
- Identify harsh frequencies with a narrow EQ boost, then reduce them for a smoother sound.  

**Pro Tip:** Cutting frequencies clears space for other elements, making your mix more balanced and cohesive.

### **6. Know When to Take Breaks**  
Mixing is both technical and artistic, and ear fatigue can impact your judgment. Step away regularly to return with fresh ears and a clearer perspective.
