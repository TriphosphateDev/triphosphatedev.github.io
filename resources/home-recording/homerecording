### Draft for **Home Recording Guide**

---

**Introduction**  
Recording at home has never been more accessible, but capturing clean, professional-quality sound from a bedroom or small home studio requires strategy and preparation. This guide will help you transform your space into a recording-friendly environment, teaching you the basics of room setup, mic placement, and recording techniques so your tracks shine—even before they hit the mixing stage.

### **1. Room Setup: The Foundation of Great Sound**
#### **Choose the Right Space**  
- Opt for a room with minimal reflective surfaces like glass or tile. Avoid small, square rooms that amplify problematic frequencies.  
- If possible, use a larger room with some soft furnishings (like couches or curtains) to absorb sound.

#### **Acoustic Treatment**  
- Start with **bass traps** in corners to control low-frequency buildup.  
- Add **acoustic panels** to walls at the reflection points for your mic. Use a mirror trick: place a mirror on the wall and sit where the mic will be; anywhere you can see the mic in the mirror is a good place for treatment.  
- Use a **rug** or carpet to prevent floor reflections if you have hard flooring.  

**Pro Tip:** *If professional treatment isn’t an option, heavy blankets, bookshelves, or DIY panels with insulation can work wonders.*

### **2. Microphone Selection and Placement**  
#### **Microphone Types**  
- **Dynamic Microphones**: Durable and good for loud sources like vocals, guitar amps, or drums (e.g., Shure SM58).  
- **Condenser Microphones**: More sensitive, ideal for capturing detailed vocals or acoustic instruments (e.g., Audio-Technica AT2020).

#### **Placement Tips**  
- **Vocals**: Place the mic at mouth level, about 6–12 inches away, angled slightly downward to reduce plosives. Use a pop filter to catch harsh sounds.  
- **Acoustic Guitar**: Aim the mic at the 12th fret for a balanced sound or experiment with pointing at the sound hole for a fuller tone.  
- **Drums**: Start with overheads for cymbals and kick/snare mics for a basic setup.  

**Pro Tip:** *Experiment with mic placement before reaching for EQ or effects—it’s easier to fix issues during recording than later.*

### **3. Signal Chain: From Mic to DAW**  
#### **Audio Interface**  
- Choose a reliable interface with low latency and clean preamps (e.g., Focusrite Scarlett or PreSonus AudioBox).  
- Ensure your input gain is set correctly—too low, and your signal will be noisy; too high, and you’ll risk distortion. Aim for peaks around -6 dB.  

#### **Monitoring**  
- Use closed-back headphones for tracking to prevent bleed into the mic.  
- Studio monitors are ideal for playback, but if you’re using headphones, choose ones with a flat frequency response (e.g., Audio-Technica ATH-M50x).

### **4. Recording Techniques: Getting It Right**  
#### **Gain Staging**  
- Keep input levels consistent and avoid clipping. Check levels frequently before recording a full take.  

#### **Double-Tracking**  
- Record multiple takes of the same part for a fuller sound. This works particularly well for guitars and backing vocals.  

#### **Minimizing Noise**  
- Turn off noisy devices like fans or air conditioners during recording.  
- Use a noise gate to clean up silent parts if needed.

### **5. Preparing for the Mix**  
- Record at 24-bit/48kHz for high-quality audio.  
- Label and organize your tracks in your DAW for a smooth transition to the mixing stage.  
- Export stems dry (without effects) unless you’re certain they’re integral to the sound.

**Conclusion**  
Home recording doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive—it just takes a little planning and attention to detail. By setting up your space and learning the fundamentals of mic placement and recording, you’ll capture tracks with clarity and confidence.
