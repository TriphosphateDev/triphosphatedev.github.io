# **Hyperpop Mixing Techniques: Controlled Chaos and Crunchy Distortion**

Hyperpop has emerged as one of the most exciting and boundary-pushing genres of the 21st century. Born from the intersection of pop, electronic, and experimental music, hyperpop thrives on exaggerated sounds, distorted vocals, and an unapologetically chaotic approach to production. It’s a genre that challenges traditional pop norms, and its evolution is happening so quickly that even defining it feels like a fluid process.

At its core, hyperpop is about pushing the boundaries of what’s considered “pop,” incorporating extreme and often unconventional sound design choices. However, with subgenres like **digicore**, **dariacore**, **glitchcore**, and more emerging at an ever-increasing rate, it’s clear that hyperpop is an umbrella term for a diverse range of sounds.

In this article, we’ll explore some key mixing techniques specific to hyperpop, look at some of its subgenres, and discuss how to maintain the genre’s signature chaotic yet controlled feel. Whether you’re working on tracks in this genre or just interested in how to mix hyperpop, we’ve got some insights for you!

### **What is Hyperpop?**
At its most basic, **hyperpop** is an experimental genre that blends elements of pop, electronic, industrial, and glitch music. Characterized by aggressive vocal processing, crunchy distortion, fast-paced tempos, and unpredictable arrangements, hyperpop is about defying conventions. The genre often features exaggerated vocal pitch, layered harmonies, glitch effects, and sharp, distorted beats.

It’s more than just a genre—it’s a culture that thrives on online communities, memes, and the influence of platforms like **SoundCloud** and **TikTok**. Key artists like **100 gecs**, **Shygirl**, **Glaive**, and **A.G. Cook** have paved the way, pushing the boundaries of mainstream pop and establishing hyperpop as a legitimate musical movement.

### **Emerging Hyperpop Subgenres**
As hyperpop continues to develop, various subgenres have emerged, each with its own set of characteristics and sound design approaches. Here are a few notable subgenres and their defining traits:

#### **1. Digicore**
- **What it is**: A subgenre that incorporates a more **digital**, **melodic**, and often more **organic sound** than traditional hyperpop. It blends pop melodies with glitchy beats, heavily processed vocals, and a DIY ethos.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Heavily pitched and warped vocals
  - Lo-fi, digital effects like bitcrushing or stuttering
  - Chopped-up melodies and heavy use of autotune
  - Music made with basic, often free digital audio workstations (DAWs)
- **Artists to Check Out**: **Glaive**, **Ericdoa**, **Aesthetic**, **Kero Kero Bonito**

#### **2. Dariacore**
- **What it is**: Dariacore leans into more **chaotic** and **distorted** sounds, using **harsh synths** and fragmented structures. It's a more abrasive take on hyperpop with a mix of noise and melody.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Glitchy, chopped-up vocals with extreme pitch shifts
  - Aggressive, distorted basslines
  - Unpredictable, fast-paced rhythmic patterns
- **Artists to Check Out**: **Darian**, **Fever 333**, **Osquinn**

#### **3. Glitchcore**
- **What it is**: As the name suggests, glitchcore is centered around **glitchy, experimental sounds** and uses heavy distortion, circuit-bent samples, and broken beats to create an intentionally “messed-up” aesthetic.
- **Key Features**:  
  - Use of **glitch effects** like stutters, skips, and robotic vocal effects
  - Chaotic, fast-paced rhythms
  - High levels of distortion and compression
- **Artists to Check Out**: **100 gecs**, **umru**, **Gupi**, **Fraxiom**

### **Hyperpop Mixing Techniques: Controlled Chaos**
Hyperpop mixing is all about balancing **chaos** with **control**. The genre embraces loud, abrasive sounds, but a good hyperpop mix ensures that the energy is channeled effectively without everything collapsing into a distorted mess. Here are a few mixing techniques to help you get that controlled chaos just right.

#### **1. Crunchy Distortion: Embrace the Grit**
One of the defining characteristics of hyperpop (and many of its subgenres) is the heavy use of **distortion**. From vocals to basslines, the genre thrives on aggressive, sometimes ear-piercing saturation.

- **Vocals**: Heavy distortion or bit-crushing on vocals gives them that signature “crunchy” sound. In hyperpop, **autotune** and **pitch correction** are often pushed to extremes, but adding a little bit of fuzz or saturation makes the vocals cut through the mix.
- **Bass**: Layer your bass sounds for depth, but don’t shy away from adding a touch of saturation or overdrive to make it punch. Especially in **digicore** or **glitchcore**, distorted basslines can give the track its raw energy.

**Pro Tip**: Use **parallel distortion** on vocals or synths. By blending the distorted version of the track with the clean signal, you get the best of both worlds—grit without losing the clarity of the original sound.

#### **2. Use Sidechaining Creatively**
Sidechaining is a classic technique used in hyperpop to create that signature **pumping** effect. But instead of just using it on the kick drum and bass, try sidechaining other elements like vocals, pads, or synths to add rhythmic movement throughout the track.

- **Sidechain to Vocals**: Sidechain pads, leads, or effects to the vocals so they “move” with the rhythm of the vocal. This technique is especially popular in **glitchcore** and **dariacore**, where you can make everything feel like it’s part of the same organic machine.
- **Use Sidechain for Transition Effects**: During transitions, a quick sidechain effect can help bring elements in and out of focus, creating dramatic drops or build-ups.

---

#### **3. Use Unconventional Reverb and Delay**
In hyperpop, reverb and delay aren’t used in subtle ways—they’re often blown out of proportion, creating a sense of vastness or pushing the chaotic energy further.

- **Giant Reverbs**: Try using **reverb** on almost everything, but **automate it** to pull it back when the track gets dense. For example, use a long reverb on the vocal during the intro, then pull it back during the verse for a more intimate sound.
- **Glitchy Delays**: Don’t be afraid of **delays** that repeat in an almost unnatural fashion, creating echoes that bounce in and out of the mix. This adds to the off-kilter vibe of hyperpop, especially when synced with beats or vocals.

---

#### **4. Layering and Panning for Width**
Hyperpop loves **wide stereo sound**, and creating space in the mix is essential. Experiment with **panning** to give your mix depth, layering different synths, vocals, and percussion elements.

- **Use multiple layers** of leads and background vocals, panning them hard left and right to create a sense of movement and spaciousness. Hyperpop often uses **doubled vocals** or **vocal chops** to fill out the sound, and panning them creatively will give the track dimension.
- **Pads and Atmosphere**: For the more atmospheric elements, use **stereo wideners** or **reverb** to create a thick, immersive environment that contrasts the sharp, distorted elements in the center.

**Pro Tip**: Don’t be afraid to **double-track** or even **quadruple-track** vocals for certain phrases, panning them all around to create that super wide, impactful sound.

---

#### **5. Sampling and Glitch Effects**
In hyperpop, sound design is king. Taking a **glitchy approach** to the mix with chopped-up samples, stuttering beats, and random vocal edits is not only accepted but encouraged.

- **Vocal Glitches**: Slice up your vocals to create stutters, or use granular synthesis to rearrange snippets of the voice. This can add a robotic, futuristic edge that fits perfectly in **glitchcore** or **dariacore**.
- **Randomized Elements**: Randomly add **audio stutters**, **distorted snippets**, or **sampled glitches** to throw off the listener’s expectations and add to the track’s chaos.

**Pro Tip**: Play around with **randomization** on effects like delay or pitch modulation to keep things unpredictable and fresh.
