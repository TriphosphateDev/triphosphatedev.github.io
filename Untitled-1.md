    <h3 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #fff;">Free Consultation</h3>

**“Do you offer a free consultation?”**  
**Answer:** *Yes, I offer a free consultation to discuss your project, goals, and how I can help. Reach out through the contact form, email, or Discord to schedule yours!*  

### **3. Update Your Call-to-Action (CTA)**  
Add “Free Consultation” to your buttons and navigation. For example:  
```html

- **Keywords:**  
  Include: “free consultation mixing services,” “mix engineer free consultation,” and “independent artist consultation.”  

### **5. Highlight in Schema Markup**  
Add a mention of the free consultation to your JSON-LD schema:  
```json

  "@type": "Offer",
  "itemOffered": {
    "@type": "Service",
    "name": "Professional Audio Mixing",
    "description": "Affordable mixing services with a free consultation for independent artists and bedroom producers"
  }
}
```

### **6. Use it in Social Proof and Testimonials**  
If applicable, highlight testimonials from artists who benefited from the consultation process.  

### **7. Promote It Visibly**  
Use language on your homepage like:
